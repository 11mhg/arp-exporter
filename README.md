# Arp Exporter


I got tired of having to diagnose arp issues post-hoc. I figured if folks are exporting tons of metrics for cpu, network bandwidth, etc, folks might be interested in a tool that can export metrics and allow filtering by labels. 

# gARP

The server is also able to gratuitously ARP for a particular IP when the target ip matches the nodes ip.... This forces upstream gateways (*cough*) to update their arp cache.
